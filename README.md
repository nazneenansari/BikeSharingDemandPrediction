## General Information
- Problem Statement
    A bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. In such an attempt, the company aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.
  The company want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market and wants to know:

  - Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
  - How well those variables describe the bike demands 

## Conclusions
- The number of bike users has increased in 2019 as compared to 2018, so it can be anticipated that the business will grow over the years without any changes in the current settings.
- The company should focus to tackle the decrease in their revenue during Spring season and in the month of July as the business in negatively impacted during these periods. This can be done by rolling out offers and discounts during Spring season.
- The bookings are less during Light Snow and Rainy days. The company should focus on servicing their bikes during this time.
- The business is doing well in the month of September and during Winter season. The company should expand the business and increase their revenue exponentially through marketing and advertising.
